# Project Description
The traditional Single-Page-Application (SPA) architecture employs client side rendering, where dynamic content is updated asynchronously and JS modifies the UI on the client side.

The Service Worker generated by Workbox precaches App Shell and additional resources and delivers them from cache in case of reload.

# Test procedure
### Start the test
- __Important before each test (!)__ : remove the old Service Worker from browser. Or tick the option "update on reload" in Chrome. 
- Start the server: `http-server -p 8080 -c-1 ./dist`
- Run test file: `node ../tests/runPerfTest.js`
- Test results are written to `perfData.json`
---------------------------------------
### Set-up
- User Profile: First Time User and Returning User
- Each time the app goes through the following cycle:
    - Initial request - Home Page (Cache warm-up / First Time User)
    - Reload - App Shell is served from cache
    ---------------------------------------
- Launch localhost:8080
- Wait 5 seconds
- Await console log
- Reload page
- Wait 5 seconds
- Await console log
- Close browser
---------------------------------------
